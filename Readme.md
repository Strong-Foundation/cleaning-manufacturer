## üí° Why Open Source?

Cleaning Manufacturer is open source because we believe in a cleaner, more affordable future for everyone. Store-bought cleaning products often come with inflated prices, hidden chemicals, and heavy marketing costs that consumers end up paying for. By open-sourcing these recipes, we‚Äôre breaking down those barriers to achieve:

- **Universal Access**: Anyone, anywhere, can easily manufacture their own cleaning products at home.
- **Lower Costs**: If everyone can make and share these recipes, the price of cleaning drops dramatically. Clean homes, workplaces, and communities no longer need to come at a high cost.
- **Collective Improvement**: Open collaboration allows these recipes to improve over time, making them more effective, safer, and adaptable for different needs.

At its core, this project is about economic and practical empowerment. Cleaning should never be a privilege‚Äîit‚Äôs a necessity. By enabling people to manufacture and distribute cleaning products on their own terms, we can all live in cleaner spaces without straining our wallets.
